* Changes in SEMI 1.1

** User setting

*** Setting variable about visible body

  `mime-view-visible-media-type-list' and
`mime-view-content-filter-alist' were abolished.  Please use
`mime-preview-condition' instead.

  Notice that `mime-preview-condition' is not list of
media-type/subtype string nor association-list.  It uses new
data-structure `ctree' (condition-tree; it is introduced to replace
`atype').  Function `ctree-set-calist-strictly' and
`ctree-set-calist-with-default' may be useful to modify it (`calist'
(condition-alist) is as same as `atype').


*** API about visible-predicates

  Interface of visible-predicates for entity elements were changed.
New interfaces are following:

    mime-view-entity-button-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-header-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-body-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-entity-separator-visible-p (entity message-info)


** API

*** entity representation

  Structure `mime-entity-info' was renamed to `mime-entity'.  So
various functions were renamed too.


*** Interface for generators or filters for entity elements

  Interface of generators or filters for entity elements were changed.
New interfaces are following:

    mime-view-insert-entity-button (entity message-info subj)


*** Format of mime-acting-condition (acting-situation)

  Format of `mime-acting-condition' were changed.  `type' and
`subtype' are separated and changed to symbol.


*** Renaming

- mime-view-buffer -> mime-preview-buffer
