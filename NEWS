* Changes in SEMI 1.1

** User setting

*** Setting variable about visible body

  'mime-view-visible-media-type-list and
'mime-view-content-filter-alist were abolished.  Please use
'mime-preview-condition instead.

  Notice that 'mime-preview-condition is not list of
media-type/subtype string nor association-list.  It uses new
data-structure `ctree' (condition-tree; it is introduced to replace
`atype').  Function 'ctree-set-calist-strictly and
'ctree-set-calist-with-default may be useful to modify it (`calist'
(condition-alist) is as same as `atype').


*** API about visible-predicates

  Interface of visible-predicates for entity elements were changed.
New interfaces are following:

    mime-view-entity-button-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-header-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-body-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-entity-separator-visible-p (entity message-info)


** API

*** entity representation

  Structure 'mime-entity-info was renamed to 'mime-entity.  So various
functions were renamed too.


*** Interface for entity-button generators

  Interface of entity-button generators was changed.  New interfaces
is following:

    mime-view-insert-entity-button (entity message-info subject)


*** mime-preview-condition and preview-situation

  Conditions about preview generation are unified to
'mime-preview-condition.  Namely other variables, such as
'mime-view-visible-media-type-list, 'mime-view-content-filter-alist,
'mime-view-image-converter-alist were abolished.

  Preview-situation is generated from entity information, running
environment and 'mime-preview-condition.  These elements are checked
to match with each other. (it is similar to acting-situation)

  Format of preview-situation is association-list.  Following key is
pre-defined:

	'type			  media-type
	'subtype		  media-subtype
	'encoding		  content-transfer-encoding
	'major-mode		  major-mode of MUA
	<STRING>		  attribute of Content-Type field.
	'body-presentation-method body-presentation-method

If 'body-presentation-method is 'with-filter, 'body-filter is used to
specify body-filter function.  If 'body-presentation-method is
function, it is called to generate presentation of entity body.

Body-filter function 'mime-view-filter-for-image refers 'image-format.

Setting for message/partial button is specified by
'mime-preview-condition instead of hard-coding.


*** Interface for body-filter

  Interface of body-filter was changed.  New interfaces is following:

    <body-filter> (situation)

Current pre-defined filters are following:

	mime-view-filter-for-text/plain (situation)
	mime-view-filter-for-text/richtext (situation)
	mime-view-filter-for-text/enriched (situation)
	mime-view-filter-for-image (situation) ; if available

'mime-view-filter-for-application/postscript was abolished.


*** Format of mime-acting-condition (acting-situation)

  Format of `mime-acting-condition' were changed.  `type' and
`subtype' are separated and changed to symbol.
