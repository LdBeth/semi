* Changes in SEMI 1.1

** User setting

*** API about visible-predicates

  Interface of visible-predicates for entity elements were changed.
New interfaces are following:

    mime-view-entity-button-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-header-visible-p (entity message-info)

    mime-view-body-visible-p (entity message-info)


*** Setting variable about visible body

  `mime-view-visible-media-type-list' was abolished.  Please use
`mime-view-body-visible-condition' instead.

  Notice that `mime-view-body-visible-condition' is not list of
media-type/subtype string.  It uses new data-structure `ctree'
(condition-tree; it is introduced to replace `atype').  Function
`ctree-set-calist-strictly' and `ctree-set-calist-with-default' may be
useful to modify it (`calist' (condition-alist) is as same as
`atype').


** API

*** entity representation

  Structure `mime-entity-info' was renamed to `mime-entity'.  So
various functions were renamed too.


*** Interface for generators or filters for entity elements

  Interface of generators or filters for entity elements were changed.
New interfaces are following:

    mime-view-insert-entity-button (entity message-info subj)
    mime-view-display-body (start end entity message-info subj)
    mime-view-entity-separator-function (entity message-info)


*** Format of mime-acting-condition (acting-situation)

  Format of `mime-acting-condition' were changed.  `type' and
`subtype' are separated and changed to symbol.
